## Earthquake Visualizer

### Background

Each year, approximately half a million earthquakes are detected throughout the world. The United States Geological Survey maintains records on these events, but visualizing such large amounts of data in a clear and understandable way can be a challenge. To that end, I have implemented an interactive data visualization using the D3.js library and data available through the USGS's public api (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/).

### Functionality

With Earthquake Visualizer, users are able to visualize earthquakes based on magnitude, location, and time of occurrence.

### Architecture and Technologies

This project was implemented with the following technologies:

- Vanilla JavaScript and D3.js (a JS library for visualizing data using web standards - implemented with SVG, Canvas, and HTML)


### Bonus Features

Why stop at earthquakes? Scientific agencies collect data on many natural disasters, including tornadoes, wildfires, and storms. In the future, I plan to extend this app to visualize data on other natural disasters in much the same way.
