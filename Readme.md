## Tornado Tracker

### Background

Each year, approximately 1,200 tornadoes hit the continental United States. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has maintained records on these events since the 1950s, but visualizing such large amounts of data in a clear and understandable way can be a challenge. To that end, I will implement an interactive data visualization using the D3.js library and data available through Data.gov and NOAA's Storm Prediction Center website (http://www.spc.noaa.gov/wcm/).

### Functionality & MVP  

With Tornado Tracker, users will be able to visualize tornado tracks by:

F-Scale
Seasonality
Property Damage
Lethality

### Architecture and Technologies

This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

- Vanilla JavaScript and D3.js

### Implementation Timeline

**Day 1**: Setup all necessary Node modules, including getting webpack up and running and D3 installed.  Create `webpack.config.js` as well as `package.json`.  Write a basic entry file and the bare bones of all 3 scripts outlined above.  Import datasets from Data.gov and NOAA SPC.


**Day 2**: Build charts.


**Day 3**: Build more charts.


**Day 4**: Style and polish the app.
